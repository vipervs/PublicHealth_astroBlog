## The Urban Air Quality Crisis

### Key Pollutants and Their Effects

| Pollutant       | Sources               | Health Impact                     | At-Risk Groups        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| PM2.5           | Vehicle emissions     | Lung inflammation, asthma         | Children, elderly     |
| NO2             | Industrial processes  | Respiratory infections            | Asthma patients       |
| Ozone           | Sunlight + pollutants | Reduced lung function             | Outdoor workers       |
| CO              | Incomplete combustion | Cardiovascular stress             | Heart disease patients|

### City Comparison (Annual Average PM2.5)

```
City          | Level (µg/m³) | WHO Guideline
--------------|---------------|--------------
New Delhi     | 98            | 5
Beijing       | 42            | 5
Los Angeles   | 12            | 5
Stockholm     | 6             | 5
```

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Urban Planning:**
   - Green space development
   - Traffic reduction zones
   - Building ventilation standards

2. **Policy Measures:**
   - Stricter emission standards
   - Renewable energy incentives
   - Public transport expansion

3. **Individual Protection:**
   - Air quality monitoring apps
   - Indoor air purification
   - Mask usage during high pollution
